I enjoy making things that soilve problems (I built a program to find the best move in battleship in the c class)
I enjoy when stuff works (It usualy doesnt)
I enjoy the process of tryting to get the math working.
i'm looking forwar to working with data structures in depth
I'm looking forward to learning about web development (I'm also taking that class)

I struggle with reading and writing to file
Pointers are also somthing I struggled with in c
I think data structures are difficult
I struggle with keeping things orginiazed on bigger projects
doing anything that requires multiple filies or things of that nature I strugle with.
