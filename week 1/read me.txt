By using a stuctured arry you can create a bag of marbles
	the marbles can have vairables like their color or whatever value you want to give them

marbles can be added with the add command by filling in a spot in the array

marbles can be removed by getting a random number and pulling from that spot in the array


you can add multiple marbles with the same name and it will work

using the pull function when there are no marbles will simply tell you there are no marbles 

inputing a incorect command (or just giberish) will just tell you to input a correct input and try again.
